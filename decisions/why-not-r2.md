Cloudflare R2 that is

Would have loved to use R2 but it seems like we need to pay $7 for limiting access to files?

ie: not private by default. Default is public all, then you can narrow down which seems. Hmm. Maybe i have this wrong, its 6am ive been up for a while.
Saving here for a future note.
