# Routing got too difficult to do here, I even replaced Traefik with Nginx Ingress Controller and it was still a mess
# Honestly, I'd eventually like another attempt at this but for now this works
# TLDR is:
# /api /api/ /api/docs should redirect to web /docs/api
# Do the routing logic in Express/Axum directly
